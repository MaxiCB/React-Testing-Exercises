# Contact Form - Testing

## Advanced React Sprint

## Testing Web Applications

## Objectives

- explain what automated testing is and its importance
- use react-testing-library for testing react components
- use react-testing-library to test user interactions with fireEvent

## Introduction

In this challenge, you will be writing tests for a contact form that has been built with React.

As a developer, you will be writing tests for every component. As we've learned, tests are a very important part of programming. The tests you will write will help you feel confident in the code you push to production!

## Instructions and/or completion requirements (MVP)

In order to complete your mission for today, you will need to write tests to help you feel confident in shipping this component. Below is a _general_ outline of how to accomplish this.

1. Take a good amount of time to use the form. Find out what behaviors you expect, and any you don't expect.
1. Write down on a peice of paper what you want to test. (This is a very important step - always plan before coding!)
1. Add your first test. This one should be a very simple test to make sure the testing setup is working.
1. Write a sufficient amount of tests to give you confidence in the project's code

_If you come across any "unexpected" behaviors, try this flow:_

- [ ] Write a test that will pass for the "exptected" behavior
- [ ] Confirm that the test fails, because of the "unexpected" behavior
- [ ] Look at the code in the project to find what is causing the behavior
- [ ] Fix the code so that your new test passes
- [ ] Celebrate that your test helped you find and fix a bug!

## Stretch goals

- Using the [REQ|RES API](https://reqres.in/), build out a POST request in the form.

  - Using the [React Testing Library Docs](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro), study how to test async calls
  - Write a new test to cover your new async call

- Add more elements to the form - eg dropdown, checkbox, etc
  - Add tests to include the new form elements
